        <p>
          Healthy food is delicious. Doing sport is enjoyable. You just need to
          start - people said. Nonsense! - I thought. To me, a 19-year-old guy,
          overweight and depressed, who ate tons of junk food to seize the
          stress, those healthy-life-gurus sounded like aliens coming from
          another planet. On their planet, it must have sounded right. On my
          planet, eating pizza was OK and jogging was exhausting. 12 years
          later, after I shed almost 100 pounds and completely changed my diet,
          I still believe we WERE on different planets. The thing is that once I
          escaped.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now I'm a coach with 7+ years of experience who founded the chain of
          sport clubs each having a fitness bar and assistance of psychologists,
          and dietitians. I'm sure that nothing will work until you know where
          you are and where you go. Possibly, you are now on the planet Fatness
          and want to escape it. Here I am to show you the way out. The gym
          itself is the spacecraft for you to reach a happy new life, with its
          fitness bars to adapt your body to new conditions and with friendly
          crew to motivate you and help on your way.

          How to stop doubting and start exercising regularly
        </h2>
        <p>
          Thousands of people dream about having a nice body. They start doing
          sport, face challenges and quit it in a few weeks or even days. Why
          does it happen? The problem is that people often do too much physical
          activity when their body is not ready for this load. Without allowing
          any recovery time between exercise sessions, they get tired quickly
          and lose motivation. We believe that you should have a smooth start
          and focus on developing a habit of doing sport regularly. So, we offer
          you a few training programs for beginners.
